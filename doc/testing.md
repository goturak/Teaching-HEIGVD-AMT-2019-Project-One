# Testing strategy

- We implemented unit testing for the Model tier to check that the classes are valid.
- We also implemented mock test for the servlet with Mockito.
- We couldnt test the DAO with arquilian because we failed to implement it in our project and the documentaion on the web is obsolete
 - we did not have time to implement load testing with Jmeter
